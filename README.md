## Problem Description
A variation of **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, A* is an informed search algorithm or best-first search. It operates on weighted graphs and aims to find the path from a starting node to a goal node with the smallest cost (e.g., shortest distance or time). The algorithm maintains a tree of paths originating at the start node and extends these paths one edge at a time until it meets its termination criteria.

## Objective
**Apply multithreading to the A* Search Algorithm.**  
By distributing the array across threads, we improve efficiency by finding the shortest path and lowest cost through parallel execution.

---

## Details
Although a variation of Dijkstra's Algorithm (which finds the shortest path by selecting edges with the least cost), A* is faster as it uses **heuristic values** to estimate path quality.  
In this project, we used the **Manhattan Distance** strategy (based on Pythagorasâ€™ Theorem) to compute the heuristic value on a rectangular grid.

### Formula:
- **f = g + h**  
  - `g` = Dijkstra distance  
  - `h` = heuristic distance  
  - `f` = resultant sum  

**Visual Representation:**  
The vertices and edges modeled on a square grid, as seen by the algorithm:

## Multithreading Application
In the main algorithm, paths are explored sequentially in all directions. By leveraging multithreading:  
1. Each of the **eight directions** is assigned to a separate thread.  
2. Paths in all directions are explored simultaneously.  
3. Parallel execution ensures improved performance without affecting correctness.

### Implementation:
```cpp
pthread_t T[8]; 
pthread_create(&T[0], NULL, firstSuccessor, NULL);
pthread_create(&T[1], NULL, secondSuccessor, NULL);
pthread_create(&T[2], NULL, thirdSuccessor, NULL);
pthread_create(&T[3], NULL, fourthSuccessor, NULL);
pthread_create(&T[4], NULL, fifthSuccessor, NULL);
pthread_create(&T[5], NULL, sixthSuccessor, NULL);
pthread_create(&T[6], NULL, seventhSuccessor, NULL);
pthread_create(&T[7], NULL, eighthSuccessor, NULL);

for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) pthread_join(T[i], NULL);
```


## Results:
The A* algorithm, enhanced with multithreading, demonstrates:
- Faster execution: Multiple directions are processed simultaneously.
- Clear grid representation: Source, destination, and shortest path are displayed effectively.

## Conclusion
The shortest path from each source vertex to the destination vertex has been successfully obtained by utilizing heuristic values across threads.
